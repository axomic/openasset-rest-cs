# openasset-rest-cs
C# library &amp; sample code for using the OpenAsset REST API v1

## Documentation
The documentation for the REST API endpoints used by this library can be found at:
http://help.openasset.com/06_Integration/REST_API

### Sample Usage
The examples below show how to establish connection to OpenAsset and get/send data.

```csharp
// import library directives
using OpenAsset.RestClient;
using OpenAsset.RestClient.Library;
using OpenAsset.RestClient.Library.Noun;
```

#### Establish Connection to OpenAsset
```csharp
string baseURL = "http://localhost";
string password = "password";
string username = "username";

// Establish connection to OpenAsset
Connection conn = Connection.GetConnection(baseURL, username, password);

// Verify credentials
bool isCorrectCredentials = conn.ValidateCredentials();
if (isCorrectCredentials)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Correct Credentials");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("Incorrect Credentials");
}
```

#### Sample Code to Get Nouns
```csharp
// Create a RestOptions object to filter search
RESTOptions<File> options = new RESTOptions<File>();

// Adding filter for rank
options.SetSearchParameter("rank", "5");

// Setting a limit of 10 files
options.Limit = 10;

// Create a List of Files to contain the response of file objects
List<File> fileList = conn.GetObjects<File>(options);

// Iterate over the list and print the filenames of the files
foreach (File fileObj in fileList) {
    Console.WriteLine(fileObj.Filename);
}
```

#### Sample Code to Create a Noun
```csharp
String filename = "test.jpg";
String filepath = "C:\\test.jpg";

// Create a new file object
File fileItem = new File();

// Add file details
fileItem.OriginalFilename = filename;
fileItem.CategoryId = 2;

// Make a POST request by setting the last parameter as TRUE
File responseFile = conn.SendObject<File>(fileItem, filepath, true);

// Get the id of the newly created file
Console.WriteLine(responseFile.Id);
```

#### Sample Code to Update a Noun
```csharp
// Create a new file object
File fileItem = new File();

// Set the id to an existing image in OpenAsset
fileItem.Id = 254;

// Updating its description field
fileItem.Description = "Updated Description!!";

// Make a PUT request by setting the last parameter as FALSE
File responseFile = conn.SendObject<File>(fileItem, false);

// Print the description of the updated file
Console.WriteLine(responseFile.Description);
```

#### Sample Code to Delete a Noun
```csharp
// Create a new file object
File fileItem = new File();

// Set the id to an existing image in OpenAsset
fileItem.Id = 254;

// Send the File object to the DeleteObject method
conn.DeleteObject(noun);

Console.WriteLine("File deleted!");
```

#### Integration of Nouns
You can also integrate individual nouns with each other. For example, the below code integrates an Album noun with the File noun. You can check out the IntegrationTest.cs file inside the TestLibrary for more examples of noun integration.
```csharp
// Establish connection to OpenAsset and validate credentials
Connection conn = Connection.GetConnection("http://192.168.4.85", "username", "password");
conn.ValidateCredentials();

// Create a new File object and set its id to an existing file in OpenAsset
File fileItem = new File();
fileItem.Id = 209;

// Create a new Album Object
Album albumItem = new Album();

// Set its properties
albumItem.Name = "Test Album";
albumItem.Description = "This is a test album";
albumItem.CompanyAlbum = true;

// Add the file object to this album
albumItem.Files.Add(fileItem);

// Make a POST request to create the album and add the file to it
Album responseAlbum = conn.SendObject<Album>(albumItem, true);

// Print the id of the newly created album
Console.WriteLine("New Album Id: " + responseAlbum.Id);

// Iterate over all the files inside the album and print their ids
List<File> fileList = responseAlbum.Files;
foreach (File file in fileList)
{
    Console.WriteLine(file.Id);
}
```
